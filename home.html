     <p align="center" style="margin-right:10px; "> Welcome to yet another successful academic year. Successful, mainly because we have seen a deeply enriching response to redefining our limits in all spheres of the teaching and learning experience, be it curricula, assessment, new teachers or new students who have been the end beneficiaries. It is indeed an honour for me as Director, to be at the service of our parent and student community in these exciting times. Real life application of knowledge and skills has been the hallmark of the education revolution at Harrison High School.

    Life is a succession of moments, with each energized day bearing its own gifts. To know how to untie the ribbons and live each one in the pursuit of excellence is to succeed. Excellence is not simply an objective but a fulfilling journey in which every member of our community strives to enable students to grow and blossom into responsible, global citizens. We have seen ample evidence of cross-culture exposure and internationalism in classrooms and outside in the year that has gone by. The caring and sensitized ethos at Harrison High has helped our students evolve into caring and achieving members of society. We cannot teach goodness as we would a quadratic equation. We can but be facilitators in this process, nudging and coaxing students and help steer their development. We do not expect them to just know, but to experience, to not just be a trail but a path blazer in their endeavors.

    It is with pride then that we see ourselves as a premier global educational center that provides a balanced holistic curriculum embodying all that is international in our very own local environment. Our students are facilitated in interacting not only with international leaders in education but also with our very own talented, professionally developed providers in education. We lend the platform and work hard backstage to applaud them in all their activities and be with them, behind them and around them. We celebrate and rejoice in their success and ours as we create a niche for ourselves in the field of education. We believe as John Dewey (1859-1952), the American education reformer believes, that 'Education is not a preparation for life, education is life itself.'
