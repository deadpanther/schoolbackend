  <h2 align="center">Play School </h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 330px;">
    Play is an important element of every child's development. When they play with other children of their age level, children learn to communicate, interact, express and improve their emotional and cognitive development.

The teachers at École Mondiale World School understand this very well which is why we place so much importance on developing your children's creativity. We aim to offer an exciting and varied program so that every child will, benefit and find their own talents recognised and skills developed.

At École Mondiale World School, we do this in a safe and secure environment which is almost like your child’s second home. Backed by an excellent student-teacher ratio of 6:1, every child is guided through this process of inquiry and well being.

    <h2 align="center">Early Years & Primary Years</h2>
    <p style="margin-right: 330px;">
    We want the students in Early Years to be confident, successful and have a sense of self and develop their independence. We recognize that each child is special and unique with their own individual needs, abilities and talents. This caring holistic environment is where the staff foster a warm nurturing learning atmosphere in partnership with parents. In so doing, we highlight and celebrate each child's abilities, talent and success.

    Supervised ably by our teachers, your child will be taught the simple, yet important aspects of life. That includes thinking creatively, making meaningful choices, taking responsibility and, interacting and working effectively with others.

    <h2 align="center">Middle Years</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 330px;">
       Students at this stage are in a critical phase of personal and intellectual development. This is a time of uncertainty, sensitivity, resistance and questioning. The International Baccalaureate has set up the Middle Years Programme to meet students` academic needs and also help students develop a personal value system to guide their own lives. It is a broad-based curriculum framework which encourages students to question, evaluate and to think critically and independently. The programme offers an education that is skill based, challenging, creative and requires a great deal of discipline. It also fosters understanding among young people around the world. The programme involves a vigorous and thorough study of various disciplines, emphasizing interdisciplinary study.

    <h2 align="center">College Councelling</h2>
    <p style="margin-right: 330px;">
       Harrison High Schools' College Counselling programme offers students a vast array of resources designed to help them find good matches between themselves and universities. We focus on career development, course selection, and planning for university throughout High School. The counsellors arrange workshops, college fairs and visits from universities around the world with an aim to prepare students for university life.

Armed with the well-articulated sense of self, students are prepared to find universities or colleges that are the best fit. At Ecole we strongly believe that the key to success is good communication among all parties: students, parents and college counsellor.

The wide range of degree courses followed by our students include but are not restricted to liberal arts, business and finance, economics, engineering, medicine, fashion design, fine art, music, film and drama.
